<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

	This document provides an overview of the various keyboard layouts and
	specifies the {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/code}} values that should be
	used for each of the keys. Unlike the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} values described
	in [[UIEvents-key]], the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values are based only on the
	key's physical location on the keyboard and do not vary based on the user's
	current locale.

	This specification was formerly titled <em>DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent
	{{KeyboardEvent/code}} Values</em>.

	<h3 id="style-conventions">Stylistic Conventions</h3>

		This specification uses the following conventions:

		*   The <a><em>key cap</em></a> or label printed on a key is shown as
			KEYCAP{&darr;}, KEYCAP{=} or KEYCAP{Q}. This is used to refer to a
			key from the user's perspective without regard for the
			{{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values in the
			generated {{KeyboardEvent}}.

		*   Glyphs representing character are shown as: GLYPH{&#x239C2;}.

		*   Unicode character encodings are shown as: UNI{U+003d}.

		*   Names of key values generated by a key press (i.e., the value of
			{{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}}) are shown as:
			KEY{ArrowDown}, KEY_NOLINK{=}, KEY_NOLINK{q} or KEY_NOLINK{Q}.

		*   Names of key codes associated with the physical keys (i.e., the
			value of {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/code}}) are shown as:
			CODE{ArrowDown}, CODE{Equal} or CODE{KeyQ}.

<h2 id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard Layout</h2>

	<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	Alphanumeric keyboards are the most common way for users to generate
	keyboard events. This section provides an overview of standard keyboards and
	their physical layouts.

	<h3 id="keyboard-common-layouts">Standard Keyboard Layouts</h3>

		This section describes the physical layouts found on commonly available
		keyboards.

		<h4 id="keyboard-sections">Keyboard Sections</h4>

			When discussing keyboard layouts, it is convenient to divide the
			standard keyboard into distinct sections and to label each row.

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-sections">
				<img src="images/keyboard-sections.svg" width="684" height="225"
					alt="The five general sections of a standard keyboard" />
				<figcaption>The five general sections of a standard keyboard</figcaption>
			</figure>

			These keyboard sections are:

			*	The <a><em>Alphanumeric</em> section</a> is the main part of the
				keyboard and is where most of the keyboard variation occurs.
				When a user selects a keyboard layout, it is the keys in this
				sections that are most affected.
			*	The <a><em>Control Pad</em></a> and <a><em>Arrow Pad</em></a>
				sections contain the arrow keys and other editing keys.
			*	The <a><em>Numpad</em></a> (also known as the "numeric keypad"
				or "number pad") contains number and math keys to make it easier
				to enter numeric data.
			*	And finally, the <a><em>Function</em> section</a> contains
				miscellaneous function keys and special keys like KEYCAP{Escape}.


			To make it easier to identify keys, the rows on the keyboard are
			named starting with "A" for the bottom row up to "E" for the top
			row. The row of keys in the Function section are considered to be in
			row "K". These row names are consistent with those given in
			[[ISO9995-1]].

			Note that many keyboards (both modern and legacy) have extra keys
			that do not fit neatly into the above sections. Some of these keys
			are covered in [[#key-media]].

		<h4 id="keyboard-101">Standard "101" Keyboard Layout</h4>

			The standard "101" keyboard (commonly referred to as the "US
			layout") is the only layout that has a CODE{Backslash} key (labeled
			KEYCAP{\|}) above a single-row KEYCAP{Enter} key. All the other
			layouts omit this key and expand the KEYCAP{Enter} key to
			occupy two-rows.

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-101-us">
				<img src="images/keyboard-101-us.svg" width="684" height="225" alt="Standard '101' keyboard layout" />
				<figcaption>Standard "101" keyboard layout showing unmodified US key values</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Modern standard "101"-layout keyboards actually contain 104 keys: 61
			keys in the <a>alphanumeric section</a> and 43 keys in the
			<a>numpad</a>, <a>control pad</a>, <a>arrow pad</a> and <a>function
			sections</a>. The "101" name for this keyboard layout dates to the
			time when this standard keyboard did in fact contain 101 keys. The
			two KEYCAP{Meta} keys (commonly given an OS-specific label), and the
			KEYCAP{Menu} key were added later to bring the total to 104 keys.

		<h4 id="keyboard-101alt">Alternate "101" Keyboard Layout</h4>

			The alternate "101" keyboard has a large KEYCAP{Enter} key and
			shrinks the KEYCAP{Backspace} key to make room for the CODE{IntlYen}
			key (which replaces the CODE{Backslash} key found in the standard
			101 layout). The CODE{IntlYen} name comes from the Japanese layout
			where this is the KEYCAP{¥} (PHONETIC{yen}) key — in the Russian
			layout shown below this key maps to a KEYCAP{\/}.

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-101-russian">
				<img src="images/keyboard-101-russian.svg" width="684" height="225" alt="Alternate '101' keyboard layout" />
				<figcaption>Alternate "101" keyboard layout showing unmodified Russian key values</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Modern alternate "101"-layout keyboards contain 104 keys: 61 keys in
			the <a>alphanumeric section</a> and 43 keys in the <a>numpad</a>,
			<a>control pad</a>, <a>arrow pad</a> and <a>function sections</a>.

		<h4 id="keyboard-102">Standard "102" Keyboard Layout</h4>

			The standard "102" keyboard is common throughout Europe and adds a
			key that doesn't exist on the "101" layouts: The CODE{IntlBackslash}
			key (labelled KEYCAP{\|} on a UK keyboard) next to the left shift
			key.

			A second key is also added (labelled KEYCAP{#~} on a UK
			keyboard) which is partially tucked under the KEYCAP{Enter} key.
			This key is encoded as CODE{Backslash}, using the same code as the
			KEYCAP{\|} key found on the "101" keyboard layout.
			According to [[USB-HID]], the US KEYCAP{\|} and UK KEYCAP{#~} are
			actually two separate keys (named "Keyboard \ and |" and "Keyboard
			Non-US # and ~"), but since these two keys never co-occur on the
			same keyboard most platforms use the same scancode for both keys,
			making them difficult to distinguish. It is for this reason that the
			code CODE{Backslash} is used for both of these keys.

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-102-uk">
				<img src="images/keyboard-102-uk.svg" width="684" height="225" alt="Standard '102' keyboard layout" />
				<figcaption>Standard "102" keyboard layout showing unmodified UK key values</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Modern "102"-layout keyboards contain 105 keys: 62 keys in the
			<a>alphanumeric section</a> and 43 keys in the <a>numpad</a>,
			<a>control pad</a>, <a>arrow pad</a> and <a>function sections</a>.

		<h4 id="keyboard-103">Korean "103" Keyboard Layout</h4>

			The Korean "103" keyboard is based on the alternate 101 layout and
			adds two additional keys (one on each side of the spacebar) to
			handle Korean-specific input modes. These keys are
				CODE{Lang2} ("Hanja", labelled KEYCAP{한자} PHONETIC{hanja})
			and
				CODE{Lang1} ("HangulMode", labelled KEYCAP{한/영} PHONETIC{han/yeong}).

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-103-korean">

				<figcaption>Korean "103" keyboard layout showing unmodified Korean key values</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Modern "103"-layout keyboards contain 106 keys: 63 keys in the
			<a>alphanumeric section</a> and 43 keys in the <a>numpad</a>,
			<a>control pad</a>, <a>arrow pad</a> and <a>function sections</a>.

		<h4 id="keyboard-104">Brazilian "104" Keyboard Layout</h4>

			The "104" layout used in Brazil adds 4 new keys: two keys
			from the "102" layout (CODE{Backslash} and CODE{IntlBackslash}) plus
			the CODE{IntlRo} key (next to the right shift key) and an extra key
			on the numeric keypad. This new keypad key is called
			CODE{NumpadComma} because it represents the thousands separator. On
			the Brazilian key layout, this key is labelled KEYCAP{.} and the
			CODE{NumpadDecimal} key is labelled KEYCAP{,}.

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-104-brazilian">
				<img src="images/keyboard-104-brazilian.svg" width="684" height="225" alt="Standard '104' keyboard layout" />
				<figcaption>Standard "104" keyboard layout showing unmodified Brazilian key values</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Modern "104"-layout keyboards contain 107 keys: 63 keys in the
			<a>alphanumeric section</a> and 44 keys in the <a>numpad</a>,
			<a>control pad</a>, <a>arrow pad</a> and <a>function sections</a>.
			Some Brazilian keyboards lack the extra <a>keypad</a> key and have
			only 106 keys.

		<h4 id="keyboard-106">Japanese "106" Keyboard Layout</h4>

			The Japanese "106" keyboard layout adds 3 new keys:
				CODE{IntlYen} (labelled KEYCAP{¥_}),
				CODE{Backslash} (labelled KEYCAP{]む})
			and
				CODE{IntlRo} (labelled KEYCAP{\ろ}).
			It also shrinks the spacebar to make room for 3 input mode keys:
				CODE{NonConvert} (labelled KEYCAP{無変換} PHONETIC{muhenkan}),
				CODE{Convert} (labelled KEYCAP{変換} PHONETIC{henkan})
			and
				CODE{KanaMode} (labelled KEYCAP{カタカナ/ひらがな/ローマ字} PHONETIC{katakana/hiragana/romaji}).

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-106-japanese">
				<img src="images/keyboard-106-japanese.svg" width="684" height="225" alt="Standard '106' keyboard layout" />
				<figcaption>Standard "106" keyboard layout showing unmodified Japanese key values</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Modern "106"-layout keyboards contain 109 keys: 66 keys in the
			<a>alphanumeric section</a> and 43 keys in the <a>numpad</a>,
			<a>control pad</a>, <a>arrow pad</a> and <a>function sections</a>.

		<h4 id="keyboard-mac">Apple Keyboard Layout</h4>

			In general, Apple keyboards follow the same layout as PC keyboards,
			but there are some differences as noted in the following figure.

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-mac">
				<img src="images/keyboard-mac.svg" width="684" height="225" alt="Apple extended keyboard layout" />
				<figcaption>Apple extended keyboard layout showing unmodified English key values</figcaption>
			</figure>

			In this figure, the green keys are those that have been moved to a
			new location while the blue keys indicate keys that have been added.

		<h4 id="keyboard-laptops">Laptop Keyboard Layouts</h4>

			The limited space available on laptop keyboards often means that the
			physical key layout needs to be adjusted to fit all the required
			keys. The <a>writing system keys</a> in the <a>alphanumeric
			section</a> tend to remain intact, but the other keyboard sections
			are usually combined with other keys or removed altogether.

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-laptop-mac">
				<img src="images/keyboard-laptop-mac.svg" width="420" height="180" alt="Apple laptop keyboard layout" />
				<figcaption>Apple laptop keyboard layout</figcaption>
			</figure>

			In this Apple laptop keyboard, the right control key has been
			removed to make room for half-height arrow keys and a KEYCAP{Fn} key
			is added on the left.

			<figure id="figure-keyboard-laptop">
				<img src="images/keyboard-laptop.svg" width="460" height="180" alt="Sample PC laptop keyboard layout" />
				<figcaption>Sample PC laptop keyboard layout</figcaption>
			</figure>

			PC laptop keyboards vary considerably, but this sample keyboard
			demonstrates some commonly found aspects. The <a>control pad</a>
			keys are added along the right-hand side with the <a>arrow pad</a>
			keys tucked in along the bottom. The right KEYCAP{Shift} key is
			often shrunk to make room for the up arrow key and the right
			KEYCAP{Meta} key is typically removed altogether.

	<h3 id="keyboard-mobile">Mobile Keypads</h3>

		In the case where a content author wishes to rely on the mechanical
		layout of a mobile keypad, this specification suggests the keyboard
		configuration specified in [[ISO9995-8]], which defines a numeric keypad
		layout and secondary assignment of Unicode characters in the range
		UNI{U+0061} ... UNI{U+007A} (GLYPH{a} - GLYPH{z}) to the number keys
		KEYCAP{2} through KEYCAP{9}, as a common layout appropriate to some
		international uses.

		<p class="note">
		This keypad layout, and in particular the distribution of letters is for
		English devices, and will not match the keypads or configurations of
		many users.	 Content authors cannot rely upon any particular
		configuration, and are expected to create content in an
		internationalized and localizable manner.
		</p>

		<figure id="figure-numeric-keypad">
			<img src="images/mobile-keypad.svg" width="140" height="305" alt="Mobile keypad layout" />
			<figcaption>A graphical depiction of a generic mobile keypad.</figcaption>
		</figure>

	<h3 id="remote-control">Media Remote Controls</h3>

		Many keyboards contain special keys to control media functions.
		Increasingly, many media devices, especially televisions, are
		Web-enabled.  Hybrid keyboard/remote-control devices are becoming more
		common.	 To meet the needs of these hybrid Web/media devices, this
		specification defines keys that are common as remote control buttons, in
		addition to traditional keyboard keys.

		Because of the smaller form factor, keys (or buttons) on a remote
		control will often be modal, with one key performing different functions
		based on the context of the on-screen content. Additionally, many keys
		serve as toggles, to change back and forth between two or more states
		(see toggling keys). These remote control buttons typically do not have
		modifier states so each button is assigned a single function (like
		KEYCAP{Play}, KEYCAP{Pause}, KEYCAP{Up}, KEYCAP{Menu} or KEYCAP{Exit}).

		<figure id="figure-media-remote-control">
			<img src="images/remote-control.svg" width="102" height="422" alt="A sample media remote control" />
			<figcaption>A graphical depiction of a media remote control.</figcaption>
		</figure>

	<h3 id="keyboard-chording-virtual">Virtual Keyboards and Chording Keyboards</h3>

		Virtual keyboards are software-based sets of keys, in a variety of
		different arrangements, commonly found on touch-screen devices. They are
		often modal, with the ability to switch between different dynamic sets
		of keys, such as alphabetic, numeric, or symbolic keys.	 Because of the
		lack of physical constraints, these keyboards MAY present the widest
		range of characters, including emoticons and other symbols, and MAY have
		keys not represented by Unicode [[!Unicode]] or by the <a>key value
		tables</a> [[!!UIEvents-key]]. Wherever possible, however, virtual
		keyboards SHOULD produce the normal range of keyboard events and values,
		for ease of authoring and compatibility with existing content.

		Chording keyboards, also know as chorded keysets or chord keyboards, are
		key input devices which produce values by pressing several keys in
		combination or sequence, normally to simulate a full range of characters
		or commands on a reduced set of keys, often for single-handed use.	A
		chording keyboard MAY have additional mode keys to switch between key
		values, and the number and type of keys pressed to produce a key value
		will vary, but the final key values produced by such keyboards SHOULD
		match the range of key values described in this specification.

		For these and other alternative modal keyboards, the
		{{KeyboardEvent/key}} values
			KEY{Alphanumeric},
			KEY{CapsLock},
			KEY{NumLock},
		and
			KEY{SymbolLock}
		are RECOMMENDED for the keys which switch between different modes.

<h2 id="code-value-tables">Keyboard Event {{KeyboardEvent/code}} Value Tables</h2>

	This section defines a list of {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values which
	implementations MUST support.

	A <dfn>valid {{KeyboardEvent}} {{KeyboardEvent/code}}</dfn> is any of the
	strings given in the first column of the tables (highlighted in
	<code class="code">lavender</code>) in this section.

	<h3 id="keyboard-key-codes">Key Codes for Standard Keyboards</h3>

		This section describes the various keyboard sections in more detail and
		defines the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values that should be used for each
		key.

		<h4 id="key-alphanumeric-section">Alphanumeric Section</h4>

			The <a>alphanumeric section</a> keys fall into two general
			categories: <a><em>writing system</em> keys</a> whose meaning
			changes based on the current keyboard layout, and
			<a><em>functional</em> keys</a> which are (mostly) the same for all
			layouts.

			<h5 id="key-alphanumeric-writing-system">Writing System Keys</h5>

				The <a><em>writing system</em> keys</a> are those that change
				meaning (i.e., they produce different {{KeyboardEvent/key}}
				values) based on the current keyboard layout.

				<figure id="figure-keyboard-codes-alphanum1">
					<img src="images/keyboard-codes-alphanum1.svg" width="653" height="225" alt="The writing system keys" />
					<figcaption>The <a>writing system keys</a> in the <a>alphanumeric section</a></figcaption>
				</figure>

				This figure shows a hypothetical keyboard that combines all the
				<a>writing system keys</a> (shown in blue and green) found on the
				various keyboards. Blue keys are present on all standard
				keyboards while green keys are only available on some keyboards.

				The name shown on each key is the {{KeyboardEvent/code}}
				assigned to that key. Wherever possible, the
				{{KeyboardEvent/code}} names are based on the name for the US
				key in that position (i.e., they are based on the US keyboard
				layout). For keys that don't exist on the US keyboard, names
				from the UK or Japanese layouts are used instead.

				Note that there are two CODE{Backslash} keys in this figure: a
				large one at the end of Row D on the 101-key layout, and a
				smaller one between CODE{Quote} and CODE{Enter} on Row C of the
				102-, 104- and 106-key layouts. Only one CODE{Backslash} key
				may be present on a keyboard layout.

			<h5 id="key-alphanumeric-functional">Functional Keys</h5>

				The <a>functional keys</a> (<em>not to be confused with the
				<a>function keys</a> described later</em>) are those keys in the
				<a>alphanumeric section</a> that provide general editing
				functions that are common to all locales (like KEYCAP{Shift},

				On some keyboards (notably Japanese and Korean) the spacebar is

			For Numpads that provide keys not listed here, a

		<h4 id="key-function-section">Function Section</h4>

			The <a>function section</a> runs along the top of the keyboard and
			contains the <a>function keys</a> and a few additional special keys
			(for example, KEYCAP{Esc} and KEYCAP{Print Screen}).

			On some keyboards (especially those found on laptops or other
			portable computers), the <a>function keys</a> (KEYCAP{F1} ...
			KEYCAP{F12}) are defined to have other primary functions (like
			controlling display brightness or audio volume) and require that a
			separate KEYCAP{Fn} key be pressed to make them act as function
			keys. Unfortunately, the primary functions assigned to these keys
			varies widely from one manufacturer to the next. Because of this,
			the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} is always set to the <a>function key</a>
			name.

			BEGIN_CODE_TABLE function "List of code values for keys in the Function section."

				CODE Fn			KEYCAP{Fn} This is typically a hardware key that does not generate a separate
								code. Most keyboards do not place this key in the Function section, but it is
								included here to keep it with related keys.

								Natural Keyboard.

				CODE ScrollLock		KEYCAP{Scroll Lock}
				CODE Pause		KEYCAP{Pause Break}
			END_CODE_TABLE

			For keyboards that provide more than 12 <a>function keys</a>, the
			{{KeyboardEvent/code}} value follows the pattern shown above with
			"F" followed by the <a>function key</a> number - CODE_NOLINK{F13},
			CODE_NOLINK{F14}, CODE_NOLINK{F15}, and so on.

			<p class="note">
			Apple keyboards may have KEYCAP{Eject} or KEYCAP{Power} keys in the
			<a>function section</a>. The {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values for these
			keys are defined in [[#key-media]].
			</p>

		<h4 id="key-media">Media Keys</h4>

			Keys that fall outside the sections listed above are referred to as
			<a>media keys</a> since they commonly provide "media" functions like
			play, pause or volume control.

			These are extra keys that many keyboard manufacturers add, but do
			not have a consistent location. These keys are often distinct from
			normal typing keys in appearance and may be recessed in the
			keyboard.

			On laptop keyboards, these keys are often merged with the
			<a>function keys</a>, with the <a>media key</a> interpretation being
			the primary function of the key and the <a>function key</a>
			interpretation requiring the KEYCAP{Fn} key to be pressed at the
			same time. In this configuration the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} should
			be set to match the <a>function key</a> (CODE{F1} ... CODE{F12}).
			When the keys are merged in this fashion, the {{KeyboardEvent/code}}
			values are taken from the <a>function key</a> value because the
			<a>media key</a> value is not consistent across keyboards.

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>

: <dfn>alphanumeric section</dfn>
::	The main section of the keyboard that contains both the <a>writing system
	keys</a> and the <a>functional keys</a>. See [[#key-alphanumeric-section]].

: <dfn lt="arrow pad|arrow pad section">arrow pad section</dfn>
::	The section of the keyboard that contains the 4 arrow keys (KEYCAP{&uarr;},
	KEYCAP{&darr;}, KEYCAP{&larr;}, KEYCAP{&rarr;}). The keys are commonly
	arranged in an "upside-down T" configuration. See [[#key-arrowpad-section]].

: <dfn lt="control pad|control pad section">control pad section</dfn>
::	The control pad section of a keyboard is the set of (usually 6) keys that
	perform navigating and editing operations, for example, KEYCAP{Home},
	KEYCAP{PageUp} and KEYCAP{Insert}. See [[#key-controlpad-section]].

: <dfn>function key</dfn>
::	Any of the keys labelled KEYCAP{F1} ... KEYCAP{F12} that an application or
	operating system can associate with a custom function or action.

: <dfn>function section</dfn>
::	The row of keys typically found along the top of the keyboard above the
	<a>alphanumeric section</a>. The function section contains the <a>function
	keys</a> and a few other keys like KEYCAP{Escape} and KEYCAP{Print Screen}.
	See [[#key-function-section]].

: <dfn>functional key</dfn>
::	Any of the keys in the <a>alphanumeric section</a> that perform a particular
	function that is typically the same for all locales. These keys are in
	contrast to the <a>writing system keys</a> in the <a>alphanumeric section</a>
	that tend to change drastically between locales. Some common functional keys
	are the KEYCAP{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} (spacebar), KEYCAP{Tab} and the modifier
	keys (like KEYCAP{Shift} and KEYCAP{Control}). See
	[[#key-alphanumeric-functional]].

: <dfn>keypad</dfn>
::	An alternate term for <a>numpad</a>.

: <dfn>media key</dfn>
::	Media keys are extra keys added to a keyboard that provide <em>media</em>
	related functionality like play, pause or volume control. These keys do not
	have a standard location on the keyboard so keyboards from different
	manufacturers are likely to have a different arrangement of keys or a
	completely different sets of keys.

: <dfn lt="numpad|numpad section">numpad section</dfn>
::	The numpad section is the set of keys on the keyboard arranged in a grid
	like a calculator or mobile phone. This section contains numeric and
	mathematical operator keys. Often this section will contain a KEYCAP{NumLock}
	key which causes the keys to switch between the standard numeric functions
	and mimicking the keys of the <a>control pad section</a> and <a>arrow pad
	section</a>. Laptop computers and compact keyboards will commonly omit these
	keys to save space. See [[#key-numpad-section]].

: <dfn>writing system key</dfn>
::	The keys in the <a>alphanumeric section</a> that vary depending on which
	locale is currently active. For example, the CODE{Digit2} and CODE{KeyQ}
	keys which generate KEY_NOLINK{2} and KEY_NOLINK{q} when the US locale is
	active and KEY_NOLINK{é} and KEY_NOLINK{a} when the French locale is active.
	These keys are in contrast to the <a>functional keys</a> in the
	<a>alphanumeric section</a> that perform a consistent function across
	locales. See [[#key-alphanumeric-writing-system]].
